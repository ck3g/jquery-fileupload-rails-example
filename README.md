## Yet another jQuery-fileupload-rails-example


Example using [Carrierwave](https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave) and
[jQuery-fileupload-rails](https://github.com/tors/jquery-fileupload-rails) to upload files.


  * Using JavaScript format instead of JSON for fileupload.
  * Using Rails views for create and destroy actions.
    That allow to not heavy use of JavaScript templates block.
    Taking advantage of Rails helpers such as links, i18n and etc.
